            <p>Fractal Dimensions provides the quality and efficacy you would expect from an industry leading company,
                drawing on over a decade of experience working with multi-million pound companies.</p>
            <p>Founded by me, the guy in the picture who chose to strike it out on my own, and provides the personal
                touch, commitment and investment of a new business.</p>
            <p>I have been developing websites since the late 90s and have been in love with what can be
                achieved on the web ever since and it’s only getting better! I have a vast amount of
                experience, working on anything from small scale content management system based sites to multi million
                pound turnover ecommerce sites.</p>
            <p>I am, of course, not without ambition and will grow to meet the needs of demand. I know
                designers and marketers that are more than happy to work together creatively to provide you
                with a fantastic service. I’ll do the leg work with them, so everything runs seamlessly.</p>
            <p>It’s important that all work is completed to a high standard. So if you ever decide to move
                away, the next person that takes over the code can do so with ease.</p>
